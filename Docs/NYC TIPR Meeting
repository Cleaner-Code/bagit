Scope Issues:
  Depth of ingest
  Crucial to record each others PREMIS Event information
  Depscriptive metadata - just accept
  Technical metadata - we reconstruct - but what about formats that we don't support? 
  Keep others metadata as simple bitstreams
  
  LCD Support local 



Special metadata should be tagged as significant properti

INSPECT is doing S.P. data dictionary (different data model than PREMIS) ongoing project
to incorporated 


Criteria for success in round trip (have, say, list of 7 )
    for recording provenance (log 
    get source unalternated
    old finding aids still find material (metadata still available)
    reingest succeeds
    recapture original internal ID
    Bill points out that when they get disk,  their funding agents wants to use as nth storage, so we'd have to make
      archive invertible

    Affiliates must be able to get their metadata in a form that still works
    Suggestion 
    To what extent do we need to understand one another's rights... controlled vocabularies for 
      rights (copyright md, some mets) rights md, source md



Workflow for establishing copyright
Semantics   - use LC's controlled vocabularie
Persistance identifiers


Pragmatic procedures - 



--------- examples ---------


NYU/ADL
  Starting with Filmap:
    export digi prov
    expor right info
    generate interchage descriptor	
    generate bag
    tarball
    xfer via?

--------- 
Generally, 

METS uber descriptor
 dmdSec -> Title
 	   Identifier of contributng repository
	   Contributor's identifier(s)
 amdSec
   rightsMD   -> preservation right 
 filesec - 7 files - at least - in simplest case
   TIFF/METS-1
   JP2/METS-2


structMap 1
   representation 1
   digiprovMD -> event(premis)

structMap 2
   representation 2
   digiprovMD -> event(premis)
